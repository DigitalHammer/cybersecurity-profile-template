# Cybersecurity Portfolio Template
#### This is a GitHub Page template that has been organized to create a standard cybersecurity portfolio. Similar to our programming cousins, we need to be able to display our work and skills as cybersecurity professionals. This template has been setup so you can smoothly fork the repository, modify a few settings to personalize it, and quickly upload your security write-ups and projects.

### Benefits of using a GitHub Page and this template:
- **Dependable** - Your GitHub Page is hosted by GitHub and will be live 24/7/365 as long as you still maintain the repository in your GitHub account.
- **FREE** - Like GitHub, hosting a GitHub Page doesn't cost you anything. 
- **Swift Setup** - Forking this repository (*or another of your choosing*) and changing the repository name is all that is required to have a live GitHub Page.
- **No Programming Required** - As cybersecurity professionals, it is important that we are able to display clean, well-written write-ups. You can edit your GitHub Page with the same markup/markdown languages as your write-ups (YML/HTML)

### Limitations of a GitHub Page:
- **Static Page** - GitHub Pages can look great but they are not dynamic. Which, in my opinion, also makes it an ideal candidate for a cybersecurity profile. 
- **Only One** - only one GitHub page can be hosted per GitHub account. However, you can quickly change the name of any of your repositories to reflect a new GitHub Page.

### Credit to: Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme
#### I am not a programmer and did not design the architecture of this GitHub Page. I modified the existing template made by Minimal Mistakes so it was setup for a cybersecurity portfolio. Please check him out as well as several other themes you can fork that can be easily customized.
